# IRIS-DATA-CLASSIFICATION

Classifying the Iris dataset using machine learning is a classic and straightforward task. The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each from one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica). Each sample has four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The goal is to build a machine learning model that can classify these iris flowers into their respective species based on these features.
